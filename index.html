                    Brandon Minard was once a young man, at the tender age of 24 he is taking a computer programming
                    class.
                    Due to his father being a programmer, he has grown up with progrommatic ideals being burned into his
                    lackadaisical mind.
                    For five years he worked QA at a company that has been banned from many European nations due to the
                    sensitive nature of scholarly research and the differing ideals between them and the United States,
                    and the ideals of freely presenting government funded research.
                    His main interests are reading, video games, and sleeping.
                    A long while ago he had aspirations, alas those have evaporated over years of inaction and a lacking
                    commitment to much of anything.
                    He wanted to be a writer at one point, and as such focused on being able to type grammatically
                    correctly, and quickly.
                    Not to mention his ability to stretch even the most simplistic of prompts over a great many lines.
